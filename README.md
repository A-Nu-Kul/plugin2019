= Why Gandhipeacedonation was made =

Gandhipeacedonation was built because when we were tired of seeing non-profits use hosted fundraising platforms that charge hefty fees and strip them of the ability to brand & control their donation pages. Other WordPress donation plugins existed, but they missed important functionality or were poorly supported, leaving non-profits to choose between expensive platforms or plugins lacking the features they really needed.

So we created & launched Gandhipeacedonation in 2019 as a feature-rich, affordable WordPress alternative to hosted fundraising platforms. With Gandhipeacedonation, we won’t charge you any transaction fees for the donations you receive, and you can use the core Gandhipeacedonation plugin for free, forever. We support Gandhipeacedonation’s development through extension purchases, which add extra features.


== Installation ==

1. Upload `Gandhipeacedonation.php` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
1. Go to Gandhipeacedonation > Add Campaign to create your first campaign!

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

Easy. Just add `[campaigns]` into your page content.
